- run *data_preprocessing.py*

It will take some time for the last two graph.

### This will create two pickle files

    clean_data.pkl


## To see dash app:
- run *app.py*
- click the link showed in python console(e.g http://127.0.0.1:8045/)

You need to have *data_preprocessing.py* and *clean_data.pkl* in the same folder as *app.py*.
